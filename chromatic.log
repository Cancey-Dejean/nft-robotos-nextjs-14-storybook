The CLI tried to run your build-storybook script, but the command failed. This indicates a problem with your Storybook. Here's what to do:

- Check the Storybook build log printed below.
- Run npm run build-storybook or yarn build-storybook yourself and make sure it outputs a valid Storybook by opening the generated index.html in your browser.
- Review the build-storybook CLI options at https://storybook.js.org/docs/configurations/cli-options/#for-build-storybook
